> A sleek and straightforward command-line calculator built with pure Java. Perfect for handling basic arithmetic without ever leaving your terminal.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Four Basic Operations**: Performs Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
* **User-Friendly CLI**: Interactive and easy-to-use command-line interface.
* **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid operators and division by zero.
* **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any machine with a Java Development Kit (JDK).
* **Lightweight & Fast**: No external libraries needed, just pure Java.

## üöÄ Demo

Here is a quick look at how the calculator works in the terminal:

```sh
$ java SimpleCalculator

Enter first number: 12.5
Enter an operator: *
Enter second number: 4
Result: 50.0
```

And here's how it handles errors:

```sh
$ java SimpleCalculator

Enter first number: 10
Enter an operator: /
Enter second number: 0
Result: Error: Cannot divide by zero.
```
